The debugger allows you to set one or more conditions, that if met will have the consequences you desire, such as taking a screenshot, pausing the editor, printing a message to the console and more! Even call a method from your own code if you want! 

**Additional features:**
- Customizable look and feel 
- Multiple layouts 
- Custom Inspector 
- Hotkeys

## Development of Graphy

### Contributing

Let's make Graphy the go-to for stats monitoring in Unity!

I would really appreciate any contributions! Below you can find a roadmap for future planned features and optimisations that you might be able to help out with. If you want to make a big pull request, please do it on the "dev" branch.

Create a GitHub issue if you want to start a discussion or request a feature, and please label appropriately.

You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2KgNEHK?) for active discussions with other members of the community.

### Roadmap

**Planned features (DEFINITELY YES):**

  - Console Module: (developed in the [console-module](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy/tree/console-module) branch)
    - Show Debug.Log messages from Unity in this module.
    - Log Graphy messages to this module.
    - Integrate Graphy commands into it.
    - Allow custom commands from user.
  - Add GfxDriver stats to the RAM module.
  - Prewarm framerates: X seconds where min/max fps are not registered to avoid loading spikes registering.
  - Scale Canvas (GetComponent<Canvas>().scaleFactor *= multiplier;) -> If it changes, set again.
  - Make UI layout adapt on the fly to compact it when not showing graphs.
    
**Other features (DEFINITELY MAYBE):** 

  - Network Stats Module
  - Audio Module:
  	- Average of the whole sound
	- Indicator for LUFS
  - Allow storing FPS for a predetermined time to allow benchmarks.
  - Dump all Graphy Data as a string to:
  	- File
	- Send to server
	- Send mail
  - Add a preprocessor key #GRAPHY to avoid adding the asset in builds
