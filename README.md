# Installation

### Unity Asset Store

* [Graphy on the Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/graphy-ultimate-stats-monitor-debugger-105778)
* For Unity 5.4+, use the [legacy version](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy/releases/tag/v1.6.0-Unity5.4)

### OpenUPM
Use the [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli) for command-line installation, suitable for automation scripts or if you prefer terminal commands.
```
openupm add com.tayx.graphy
```
### Unity Package Manager
1. **Scoped Registry Method:** You can add this package in Unity Package Manager by adding it to the Scoped Registries at Edit > Project Settings > Package Manager > Scoped Registries
	* Add `package.openupm.com` as a Scoped Registry in Project Settings
	* Set URL to `https://package.openupm.com`
	* Include `com.tayx.graphy` under Scopes
	* Graphy will then appear in Package Manager for installation ![image](https://github.com/ROBYER1/graphy/assets/10745594/dbf18c6e-a170-4128-b6c6-f12d9cb75ea6)

2. **Git URL:** If you're comfortable with direct Git integration, this method allows you to track the latest commits or specific branches.
	* Add the Git URL to your `manifest.json` dependencies.
	```
	{
	  "dependencies": {
	    ...
	    "com.tayx.graphy": "https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy.git",
	    ...
	  }
	}
	```
## Choosing an Installation Method
-   Use the **Asset Store** for the simplest installation process, directly through Unity's interface.
-   The **openupm-cli** method is best for those who use openupm and prefer command-line tools.
-   **Scoped Registries** offer a balance between ease of use and control, directly integrating with Unity's built-in package management system.
-   The **Git URL** method provides the most control and is best suited for those tracking development closely or needing specific revisions.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Open Your Unity Project**: Start Unity and open your project.
2. **Installation**: Choose your preferred installation method:
   - Via the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/graphy-ultimate-stats-monitor-debugger-105778)
   - Using the openupm-cli: Run `openupm add com.tayx.graphy` in your terminal.
   - For other methods, refer to the [Installation section](#installation).
3. **Add Graphy to Your Scene**: In Unity, navigate to `Graphy - Ultimate Stats Monitor > Prefab > Place [Graphy] in your scene`.
4. **Initial Configuration of Graphy**: To get Graphy up and running quickly:
   - **Graphy Mode**: Set to 'FULL' to enable all monitoring features.
   - **Enable On Startup**: Check this to have Graphy start monitoring as soon as your game runs.
   - **Keep Alive**: Ensure this is checked to prevent Graphy from closing unexpectedly.
   - **Background**: Choose a background to enhance visibility according to your scene's color scheme.
   - **Hotkeys**: Enable hotkeys and set them to your preferences for quick access to Graphy's features.
   - **Positioning**: Select 'TOP_RIGHT' for Graphy's location on the screen, or choose another position that doesn't obstruct gameplay.
   - **Offset**: Adjust the X and Y offsets if necessary to fine-tune Graphy's position.
5. **Run Your Project**: Play your scene in Unity to see Graphy in action, monitoring your project's performance.

For detailed usage and advanced settings, please refer to the [full documentation](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy/blob/master/Readme!%20-%20Graphy%20-%20Documentation.pdf).


## Practical Use Cases

Graphy is an indispensable tool in the Unity developer's arsenal, allowing for detailed performance analysis and debugging. Here are several practical ways to utilize Graphy:

#### Performance Optimization
Monitor and analyze FPS during gameplay to identify and address performance drops, ensuring a smooth player experience.

#### Memory Monitoring
Track memory allocation and deallocation in real-time to pinpoint potential leaks and optimize memory usage.

#### Audio Monitoring
Use the audio module to ensure balanced sound levels and to debug any audio-related performance issues.

#### Automated Debugging
Set up conditional debug actions to automatically capture screenshots, log messages, or execute custom scripts when performance thresholds are met.

Graphy's versatility makes it a valuable tool for a range of tasks from development through to QA and post-release support.

### Contributing

Let's make Graphy the go-to for stats monitoring in Unity!

I would really appreciate any contributions! Below you can find a roadmap for future planned features and optimisations that you might be able to help out with. If you want to make a big pull request, please do it on the "dev" branch.

Create a GitHub issue if you want to start a discussion or request a feature, and please label appropriately.

You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2KgNEHK?) for active discussions with other members of the community.

## Roadmap

**Planned features (No ETA):**

  - Add GfxDriver stats to the RAM module.
  - Scale Canvas (GetComponent<Canvas>().scaleFactor *= multiplier;) -> If it changes, set again.
  - Make a template for a graph + text module so people can create their own easily.
  - Allow storing FPS for a predetermined time to allow benchmarks.
  - Dump all Graphy Data as a string to:
  	- File.
	- Send to server.
	- Send mail.
  - Add a preprocessor key #GRAPHY to avoid adding the asset in builds.
